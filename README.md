## Features and bugs

* Supports kdbx v3 with native dart implementation
* Supports kdbx v4 with combination with [argon2 ffi](https://github.com/authpass/argon2_ffi)

# Argon2 support

* MacOS:
  * argon2_ffi/ios/Classes
  * `cmake . && cmake --build .`
  * `cp libargon2_ffi.dylib kdbx.dart/`
  * Might need to run: `codesign --remove-signature /usr/local/bin/dart`
